[k6](https://k6.io/docs/) is an Open source load testing tool and SaaS for engineering teams. 

Two example cases are available of k6 usage for load testing in FADI: 

* [load testing of the Kafka service](/examples/K6/Kafka/README.md) (manual k6 installation, in a pod or a VM)
* [load testing of the NiFi service](/examples/K6/NiFi/README.md) (using the [k6 Helm chart developed by CETIC](/helm/helmk6))
