K6
========

[K6](https://k6.io/docs/) is an Open source load testing tool and SaaS
for engineering teams. 

## Installation

Within the framework of FADI, 2 approaches were tested for the use of K6.

The first consists of using a helm chart developed by CETIC. You will find [here](/helm/helmk6) the link to this helm chart and its documentation.

The second approach installs K6 in an Ubuntu pod as a deployment and can be used to install it in a VM. This approach is detailed below.

### a. Deploy Ubuntu

[Here](/examples/K6/Ubuntu/deployment.yaml), you will find the Ubuntu deployment file. You can deploy it by using this command :

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### b. Install K6

First you have to enter into the pod by the following command :

```
kubectl exec -it <ubuntu_pod_name> /bin/bash
```

Then, install GO by following this [link](https://go.dev/doc/install).

To install K6, follow this [link](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/#debian-ubuntu).

## Use cases

You will find [here](/examples/K6) two use cases.
